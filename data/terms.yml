  title: "A gene for"
  misconception: "The news media is awash in reports of identifying “genes for” a myriad of phenotypes, including personality traits, mental illnesses, homosexuality, and political attitudes (<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A+gene+for+nothing.&journal=Discover&author=Sapolsky+R.&publication_year=1997&volume=18&pages=40-46\" data-title=\"Sapolsky, R.

  reality: "Because genes code for proteins, there are no “genes for” phenotypes <i>per se</i>, including behavioral phenotypes (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11191-012-9510-4\" data-title=\"Falk, R.

  title: "Antidepressant medication"
  misconception: "Medications such as tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are routinely called “antidepressants.”"
  reality: "There is little evidence that these medications are more efficacious for treating (or preventing relapse for) mood disorders than for several other conditions, such as anxiety-related disorders (e.g., panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=19616306\" data-title=\"Donovan, M.

  title: "Autism epidemic"
  misconception: "Enormous effort has been expended to uncover the sources of the “autism epidemic” (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=21388746\" data-title=\"King, C. R. (2011).

The causal factors posited to be implicated in this “epidemic” have included vaccines, television viewing, dietary allergies, antibiotics, and viruses."
  reality: "There is meager evidence that this purported epidemic reflects a genuine increase in the rates of autism <i>per se</i> as opposed to an increase in autism <i>diagnoses</i> stemming from several biases and artifacts, including heightened societal awareness of the features of autism (“detection bias”), growing incentives for school districts to report autism diagnoses, and a lowering of the diagnostic thresholds for autism across successive editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=25404790\" data-title=\"Gernsbacher, M.

Indeed, data indicate when the diagnostic criteria for autism were held constant, the rates of this disorder remained essentially constant between 1990 and 2010 (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=25108395\" data-title=\"Baxter, A.

  title: "Brain region X lights up"
  misconception: "Many authors in the popular and academic literatures use such phrases as “brain area X lit up following manipulation Y” (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=22678835\" data-title=\"Morin, C. (2011). Neuromarketing: the new science of consumer behavior. Society 48, 131–135. doi: 10.1007/s12115-010-9408-1\">Morin, 2011</a>)."
  reality: "This phrase is unfortunate for several reasons. First, the bright red and orange colors seen on functional brain imaging scans are superimposed by researchers to reflect regions of higher brain activation. Nevertheless, they may engender a perception of “illumination” in viewers. Second, the activations represented by these colors do not reflect neural activity <i>per se</i>; they reflect oxygen uptake by neurons and are at best indirect proxies of brain activity. Even then, this linkage may sometimes be unclear or perhaps absent (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=20026191\" data-title=\"Ekstrom, A. (2010). How and when the fMRI BOLD signal relates to underlying neural activity: the danger in dissociation. Brain Res. Rev. 62, 233–244. doi: 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2009.12.004\">Ekstrom, 2010</a>). Third, in almost all cases, the activations observed on brain scans are the products of <i>subtraction</i> of one experimental condition from another. Hence, they typically do not reflect the raw levels of neural activation in response to an experimental manipulation. For this reason, referring to a brain region that displays little or no activation in response to an experimental manipulation as a “dead zone” (e.g., <a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Lamont, L. (2008). Commonsense Part of Brain is a “Dead Zone” When Texting. Sydney Morning Herald.

Fourth, depending on the neurotransmitters released and the brain areas in which they are released, the regions that are “activated” in a brain scan may actually be being inhibited rather than excited (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Satel, S., and Lilienfeld, S. O. (2013). Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience. New York: Basic Books.\">Satel and Lilienfeld, 2013</a>). Hence, from a functional perspective, these areas may be being “lit down” rather than “lit up.”"

New York: Vanguard Press.\">Hunter, 1951</a>) but which is still invoked uncritically from time to time in the academic literature (e.g., <a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Ventegodt, S., Andersen, N.

  reality: "The attitude-change techniques used by so-called “brainwashers” are no different than standard persuasive methods identified by social psychologists, such as encouraging commitment to goals, manufacturing source credibility, forging an illusion of group consensus, and vivid testimonials (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=10166103\" data-title=\"Zimbardo, P.

For example, during the Korean War, only a small minority of the 3500 American political prisoners subjected to intense indoctrination techniques by Chinese captors generated false confessions. Moreover, an even smaller number (probably under 1%) displayed any signs of adherence to Communist ideologies following their return to the US, and even these were individuals who returned to Communist subcultures (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10216-000\" data-title=\"Spanos, N.

There is no known “optimal” level of neurotransmitters in the brain, so it is unclear what would constitute an “imbalance.” Nor is there evidence for an optimal ratio among different neurotransmitter levels. Moreover, although serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft), appear to alleviate the symptoms of severe depression, there is evidence that at least one serotonin reuptake <i>enhancer</i>, namely tianepine (Stablon), is also efficacious for depression (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Akiki, T.

  title: "Family genetic studies"
  misconception: "The phrase “family genetic studies” is commonly used in psychiatry to refer to designs in which investigators examine the familial aggregation of one or more disorders, such as panic disorder or major depression, within intact (i.e., non-adoptive) families (e.g., <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-3956(93)90018-W\" data-title=\"Weissman, M.

  title: "Influence of gender (or social class, education, ethnicity, depression, extraversion, intelligence, etc.) on X."
  misconception: ""
  reality: "“Influence” and cognate terms, such as effect, are inherently causal in nature. Hence, they should be used extremely judiciously in reference to individual differences, such as personality traits (e.g., extraversion), or group differences (e.g., gender), which cannot be experimentally manipulated. This is not to say that individual or group differences cannot exert a causal influence on behavior (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1991.tb00093.x\" data-title=\"Funder, D. C.

Hence, researchers should be explicit that when using such phrases as “the influence of gender,” they are almost always proposing a hypothesis from the data, not drawing a logically justified conclusion from them. This inferential limitation notwithstanding, the phrase “the influence of gender” alone appears in over 45,000 manuscripts in the <i>Google Scholar</i> database (e.g., <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00005650-199504000-00007\" data-title=\"Bertakis, K.

  title: "Operational definition"
  misconception: "The credo that all psychological investigators must develop “operational definitions” of constructs before conducting studies has become something of a truism in many psychology methods textbooks and other research sources (e.g., <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412956253.n379\" data-title=\"Burnette, J. L. (2007). “Operationalization,” in Encyclopedia of Social Psychology, eds R. F. Baumeister and K. D. Vohs (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage), 636–637. doi: 10.4135/9781412956253.n379\">Burnette, 2007</a>). Operational definitions are strict definitions of concepts in terms of their measurement operations. As a consequence, they are presumed to be exact and exhaustive definitions of these concepts. Perhaps the best known example in psychology is <a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Boring, E. G. (1923). Intelligence as the tests test it. New Republic 35, 35–37.\">Boring’s (1923)</a> definition of intelligence as whatever intelligence tests measure."
  reality: "Many psychologists appear unaware that the notion of operational definitions was roundly rejected by philosophers of science decades ago (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Leahey, T. H. (1980). The myth of operationism. J. Mind Behav. 1, 127–143.\">Leahey, 1980</a>; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959354392023003\" data-title=\"Green, C. D. (1992).

J., and Forzano, L. B. (2012). Research Methods for the Behavioral Sciences, 4th Edn. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.\">Gravetter and Forzano, 2012</a>). Operational definitions are unrealistic in virtually all domains of psychology, because constructs are not equivalent to their measurement operations (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Meehl, P. E. (1986). “Diagnostic taxa as open concepts: metatheoretical and statistical questions about reliability and construct validity in the grand strategy of nosological revision,” in Contemporary Directions in Psychopathology, eds T. Millon and G. L. Klerman (New York: Guilford Press), 215–231.\">Meehl, 1986</a>). For example, an “operational definition” of aggression as the amount of hot sauce a participant places in an experimental confederate’s drink is not an operational definition at all, because no researcher seriously believes that the amount of hot sauce placed in a drink is a perfect or precise definition of aggression that exhausts all of its potential manifestations. Operational definitions also fell out of favor because they led to logically absurd conclusions. For example, an operational definition of length would imply that length as measured by a wooden ruler cannot be compared with length as measured by a metal ruler, because these rulers are associated with different measurement operations. Hence, the fact that both rulers yield a length for a table of say, 27 inches, could not be taken as converging evidence that the table is in fact 27 inches long (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959354392023003\" data-title=\"Green, C. D. (1992). Of immortal mythological beasts: operationism in psychology. Theory Psychol. 2, 291–320. doi: 10.1177/0959354392023003\">Green, 1992</a>).<br />Psychological researchers and teachers should therefore almost always steer clear of the term “operational definition.” The term “operationalization” is superior, as it avoids the implication of an ironclad definition and is largely free of the problematic logical baggage associated with its sister term."

  title: "p = 0.000"
  misconception: "Even though this statistical expression, used in over 97,000 manuscripts according to <i>Google Scholar</i>, makes regular cameo appearances in our computer printouts, we should assiduously avoid inserting it in our <i>Results</i> sections."
  reality: "This expression implies erroneously that there is a <i>zero</i> probability that the investigators have committed a Type I error, that is, a false rejection of a true null hypothesis (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Streiner, D. L. (2007). A short cut to rejection: how not to write the results section of a paper. Can. J. Psychiatry 52, 385–389.\">Streiner, 2007</a>). That conclusion is logically absurd, because unless one has examined essentially the entire population, there is always some chance of a Type I error, no matter how meager. Needless to say, the expression “<i>p</i> &lt; 0.000” is even worse, as the probability of committing a Type I error cannot be less than zero. Authors whose computer printouts yield significance levels of <i>p</i> = 0.000 should instead express these levels out to a large number of decimal places, or at least indicate that the probability level is below a given value, such as <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01 or <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001."

  title: "Psychiatric control group"
  misconception: "This phrase and similar phrases (e.g., “normal control group,” “psychopathological control group”) connote erroneously that (a) groups of ostensibly normal individuals or mixed psychiatric patients who are being compared with (b) groups of individuals with a disorder of interest (e.g., schizophrenia, major depression) are true “control” groups."
  reality: "They are not. They are “comparison groups” and should be referred to accordingly. The phrase “control group” in this context may leave readers with the unwarranted impression that the design of the study is experimental when it is actually quasi-experimental. Just as important, this term may imply that the only difference between the two groups (e.g., a group of patients with anxiety disorder and a group of ostensibly normal individuals) is the presence or absence of the disorder of interest. In fact, these two groups almost surely differ on any number of “nuisance” variables, such as personality traits, co-occurring disorders, and family background, rendering the interpretation of most group differences open to multiple interpretations (<a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?&amp;title=Nuisance+Variables+and+the+Expost+Facto+Design%2E&amp;author=Meehl+P.+E.&amp;publication_year=1969\" data-title=\"Meehl, P.

  title: "Reliable and valid"
  misconception: "If one earned a dollar for every time an author used the sentence “This test is reliable and valid” in a <i>Method</i> section, one would be a rich person indeed, as the phrase “reliable and valid” appears in more than 190,000 manuscripts in <i>Google Scholar</i>."
  reality: "There are at least three problems with this ubiquitous phrase. First, it implies that a psychological test is either valid or not valid. Much like the testing of scientific theories, the construct validation process is never complete, in essence reflecting a “work in progress.” As a consequence, a test cannot be said to be have been conclusively validated or invalidated (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0040957\" data-title=\"Cronbach, L. J., and Meehl, P. E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. Psychol. Bull. 52, 281–302. doi: 10.1037/h0040957\">Cronbach and Meehl, 1955</a>; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1957.3.3.635\" data-title=\"Loevinger, J. (1957). Objective tests as instruments of psychological theory: monograph supplement 9. Psychological. Rep. 3, 635–694. doi: 10.2466/pr0.1957.3.3.635\">Loevinger, 1957</a>; <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3150948\" data-title=\"Peter, J. P. (1981). Construct validity: a review of basic issues and marketing practices. J. Mark. Res. 18, 133–145. doi: 10.2307/3150948\">Peter, 1981</a>). Hence, authors should similarly refrain from using the term “validated’ with respect to psychological measures. At best, these measures are “empirically supported” or have “accrued substantial evidence for construct validity.” The same caveat applies to psychological treatments. When Division 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology) of the American Psychological Association put forth its criteria for, and lists of, psychotherapies found to work in controlled trials for specific mental disorders, it initially termed them “empirically validated therapies” (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Chambless, D. L., Baker, M. J., Baucom, D. H., Beutler, L. E., Calhoun, K. S., Crits-Christoph, P., et al. (1998). Update on empirically validated therapies, II. Clin. Psychol. 51, 3–16.\">Chambless et al., 1998</a>). Nevertheless, in recognition of the fact that “validation” implies certainty or finality (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2850.1996.tb00073.x\" data-title=\"Garfield, S. L. (1996).

Psychol. 66, 7–18. doi: 10.1037/0022-006X.66.1.7\">Chambless and Hollon, 1998</a>), the committee wisely changed the name to “empirically supported therapies,” which is now the term presently in use (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=23647856\" data-title=\"Lilienfeld, S.

Psychol. Rev. 33, 883–900. doi: 10.1016/j.cpr.2012.09.008\">Lilienfeld et al., 2013</a>).<br />Second, the phrase “reliable and valid” implies that reliability and validity are unitary concepts. They are not. There are three major forms of reliability: test–retest, internal consistency, and inter-rater. Contrary to common belief, these forms of reliability often diverge, sometimes markedly (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.1.2.199\" data-title=\"Schmidt, F. L., and Hunter, J. E. (1996).

For example, scores derived from the Thematic Apperception Test, a widely used projective technique, frequently display high levels of test–retest reliability but low levels of internal consistency (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0020021\" data-title=\"Entwistle, D. R. (1972). To dispel fantasies about fantasy-based measures of achievement motivation. Psychol. Bull. 77, 377–391. doi: 10.1037/h0020021\">Entwistle, 1972</a>). There are also multiple forms of validity (e.g., content, criterion-related, incremental), which similarly do not necessarily coincide. For example, a measure may possess high levels of criterion-related validity in multiple samples but little or no incremental validity above and beyond extant information (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=14692846\" data-title=\"Garb, H.

Hence, the notion that a test is “reliable and valid” independent of the nature of the sample runs counter to contemporary thinking in psychometrics (<a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?&amp;title=The+Standards+for+Educational+and+Psychological+Testing%2E&amp;publication_year=2014\" data-title=\" American Psychological Association and American Educational Research Association.

Indeed, given the low statistical power of most studies in psychology, a reasonable argument could be advanced that most statistically significant results are unlikely to be reliable.

  title: "The scientific method"
  misconception: "Many science textbooks, including those in psychology, present science as a monolithic “method.” Most often, they describe this method as a hypothetical-deductive recipe, in which scientists begin with an overarching theory, deduce hypotheses (predictions) from that theory, test these hypotheses, and examine the fit between data and theory. If the data are inconsistent with the theory, the theory is modified or abandoned."
  reality: "It’s a nice story, but it rarely works this way (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1996.tb10205.x\" data-title=\"McComas, W. F. (1996).

Specifically, it is an approach that strives to better approximate the state of nature by reducing errors in inferences. Alternatively, one can conceptualize science as a toolbox of finely honed tools designed to minimize mistakes, especially confirmation bias – the ubiquitous propensity to seek out and selectively interpret evidence consistent with our hypotheses and to deny, dismiss, and distort evidence that does not (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Tavris, C., and Aronson, E.

By engaging in splitting, people with BPD and similar conditions are hypothesized to avoid the anxiety of perceiving those they love as the hopelessly flawed creatures that they are."
  reality: "This term is consistently misused to refer to the propensity of people with BPD to “pit” staff members on a psychiatric unit (or other caregivers) against one another. This disruptive behavior, sometimes termed “staff splitting” (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Linehan, M. M. (1989). Cognitive and behavior therapy for borderline personality disorder. Rev. Psychiatry 8, 84–102.\">Linehan, 1989</a>), should not be confused with the formal meaning of splitting.<br />More broadly, we can differentiate between two quite different brands of reductionism: constitutive and eliminative, the latter termed “greedy reductionism” by <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.2326-1951.1995.tb03633.x\" data-title=\"Dennett, D.

The constitutive reductionist believes merely that everything that is “mental” is ultimately material at some level, and that the “mind” is what the brain and rest of the central nervous system do. Constitutive reductionists (like nomological reductionists; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=7048388\" data-title=\"Robinson, D. N.

In contrast, eliminative reductionists go a large step further (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10608-007-9127-0\" data-title=\"Lilienfeld, S. O. (2007).

They contend that the “mind” will eventually be <i>explained away</i> entirely by lower-level concepts derived from neuroscience, and that mentalist concepts, such as thoughts, motives, and emotions, will ultimately be rendered superfluous by neuroscientific explanations. For eliminative reductionists, the field of psychology will eventually be “gobbled up” by neuroscience. Although we do not attempt to adjudicate the dispute between constitutive and eliminative reductionists here, suffice it to say that “reductionism” does not carry a single meaning in psychology. As a result, psychologists who use “reductionist” as a handy term of opprobrium against their colleagues must be explicit about which form of reductionism they are invoking."

  title: "Comorbidity"
  misconception: "This term, which has become ubiquitous in publications on the relations between two or more mental disorders (appearing in approximately 444,000 citations in <i>Google Scholar</i>), refers to the overlap between two diagnoses, such as major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. A similar term, “dual diagnosis,” which has acquired considerable currency in the substance abuse literature in particular, refers to the simultaneous presence of a mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and a substance abuse disorder, such as alcoholism (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0920-9964(98)00161-3\" data-title=\"Dixon, L.

O., Waldman, I. D., and Israel, A. C. (1994). A critical examination of the use of the term and concept of comorbidity in psychopathology research. Clin.

The first meaning refers to the extent to which Condition A and B are statistically associated across individuals; for example, there is substantial covariation between ASPD and BPD (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.157.12.2011\" data-title=\"Becker, D.

Psychiatry 157, 2011–2016. doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.12.2011\">Becker et al., 2014</a>). The second meaning is a conditional probability referring to the proportion of individuals with Condition A who meet diagnostic criteria for Condition B. For example, in the case of the latter meaning, researchers might note that 45% of patients with ASPD also meet diagnostic criteria for BPD. The difference between these two meanings is hardly trivial, because they tend to be differentially influenced by base rates (prevalences). If the base rates of one or more conditions change, the covariation between them will not necessarily be affected but the level of co-occurrence almost always will be (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Lilienfeld, S.

Psychol. 1, 71–83.\">Lilienfeld et al., 1994</a>). Moreover, depending on the base rates of the diagnoses in a sample, two conditions may display little or no covariation but substantial co-occurrence. For example, although ASPD and major depression typically display only modest covariation (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0165-1781(02)00320-7\" data-title=\"Goodwin, R. D., and Hamilton, S. P.

Psychiatry Res. 117, 159–166. doi: 10.1016/S0165-1781(02)00320-7\">Goodwin and Hamilton, 2003</a>), the rates of co-occurrence between ASPD and major depression in an analysis conditioned on major depression (that is, the rates of ASPD among people with major depression) would be extremely high in a prison sample, because most prison inmates meet criteria for ASPD (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J076v19n01_01\" data-title=\"Flint-Stevens, G. (1993). Applying the diagnosis of antisocial personality to imprisoned offenders: looking for hay in in a haystack. J. Offender Rehabil. 19, 1–26. doi: 10.1300/J076v19n01_01\">Flint-Stevens, 1993</a>). Hence, the levels of comorbidity would probably be negligible in the first case but high in the second. If authors elect to use the term “comorbidity,” they should therefore be explicit about which meaning (covariation or co-occurrence) they intend.<br />Some authors (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Lilienfeld, S. O., Waldman, I. D., and Israel, A. C. (1994). A critical examination of the use of the term and concept of comorbidity in psychopathology research. Clin. Psychol. 1, 71–83.\">Lilienfeld et al., 1994</a>) have further questioned the routine use of the term comorbidity in psychopathology research given that this term, much like “dual diagnosis,” presupposes that the conditions in question are etiologically and pathologically separable entities (but see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=12413409\" data-title=\"Rutter, M. (1994). Comorbidity: meanings and mechanisms. Clin. Psychol. 1, 100–103. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2850.1994.tb00012.x\">Rutter, 1994</a>; <a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Spitzer, R. L. (1994). Psychiatric “co-occurrence”? I’ll stick with “comorbidity.” Clin. Psychol. 1, 88–92.\">Spitzer, 1994</a>, for demurrals). For example, although the high level of “comorbidity” between ASPD and BPD may reflect covariation or co-occurrence between two distinct conditions, it may instead reflect the fact that the current diagnostic system is attaching different names to slightly different manifestations of a shared diathesis, thereby falling prey to a jangle fallacy. To take an admittedly extreme example, how likely is it that a participant in a published study who simultaneously met diagnostic criteria for all 10 DSM personality disorders (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=23647856\" data-title=\"Lilienfeld, S.

Critics of the expansive application of the term comorbidity to descriptive psychopathology contend that these diagnostic conundrums are best explained by a flawed diagnostic system that is attaching different names to highly overlapping constructs."

  misconception: "As <a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Olweus, D.

Endler (New York: Wiley), 221–233.\">Olweus (1977)</a> observed in the context of the person-situation debate, the term “interaction” has multiple meanings, some of them logically incompatible."
  reality: "For example, the familiar phrase “genes and environment interact for Disorder X” can mean any one of four things: (a) genes and environment are both involved in the causes of Disorder X; (b) the relation between genes and environments are bidirectional, because genes influence the environments to which people are exposed (by means of gene-environment correlations), and environments influence which genes are activated or inactivated (by means of epigenetic processes); (c) the influences of genes and environment are inseparable because of continuous transaction within individuals; or (d) the statistical effects of genes depend on people’s environments, and the statistical effects of environments depend on people’s genes. Only meaning (d) refers to a statistical interaction in the standard multiple regression or analysis of variance sense.<br />Two points are worth noting here. First, psychologists routinely confuse meanings (a) and (d). For example, when researchers write that “All reasonable scholars today agree that genes and environment interact to determine complex cognitive outcomes” (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Bates, E., Elman, J., Johnson, M., Karmiloff-Smith, A., Parisi, D., and Plunkett, K.

Graham (Oxford: Basil Blackwell), 590–601.\">Bates et al., 1998</a>, p. 195), some readers may assume that they are referring to the standard statistical meaning of the term “interaction,” (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.114.2.376\" data-title=\"McClelland, G. H., and Judd, C. M. (1993). Statistical difficulties of detecting interactions and moderator effects. Psychol.

Instead, in this case the authors appear to be saying only that both genes and environment play a role in cognitive outcomes, a scenario that does not require a multiplicative relation between genes and environment. Second, meanings (c) and (d) are logically incompatible, because if the effects of genes and environment are not separable, then clearly they cannot be distinguished in statistical designs. The bottom line: when authors use the term “interaction,” they should be explicit about which of the four meanings they intend."

In contrast, in stepwise multiple regression, the investigators allows the computer to select the order of entry of the variables (and the final variables in the equation) on empirical grounds, namely, by choosing each successive predictor based on the highest incremental contribution to variability in the outcome variable (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-0167.34.4.372\" data-title=\"Wampold, B.

  title: "Mind-body therapies"

  reality: "This term implies erroneously that the “mind” is materially separate from the “body” and thereby endorses a simplistic version of mind-body dualism.

  title: "Personality type"
  misconception: "Typologies have a lengthy history in personality psychology harkening back to the writings of the Roman physician Galen and later, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung."
  reality: "The assertion that personality traits fall into distinct categories (e.g., introvert vs. extravert) has received minimal scientific support. Taxometric studies consistently suggest that normal-range personality traits, such as extraversion and impulsivity, are underpinned by dimensions rather than taxa, that is, categories in nature (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=21939592\" data-title=\"Haslam, N., Holland, E., and Kuppens, P.

Psychol. 122, 475–491. doi: 10.1037/a0032713\">Ahmed et al., 2013</a>), the same conclusion holds for personality disorders (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=21939592\" data-title=\"Haslam, N., Holland, E., and Kuppens, P.

  title: "Prevalence of trait X"
  misconception: "Authors in the psychological and psychiatric literatures frequently refer to “the prevalence” or “base rate” of attributes that are dimensionally distributed in the population, such as personality traits and intelligence. For example, one author team referred to the “greater prevalence of extraversion in American students” (p. 1153) compared with Korean students (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2012.40.7.1153\" data-title=\"Song, H., and Kwon, N.

Personal. 40, 1153–1162. doi: 10.2224/sbp.2012.40.7.1153\">Song and Kwon, 2012</a>)."
  reality: "such terms as “prevalence,” “incidence,” “base rate,” “false positive,” and “false negative” are premised on a taxonic model: they presume that the phenomena in question are inherently categorical, that is, either present or absent in nature. For psychological features that are continuously distributed, such terms should be avoided. In the aforementioned phrase, referring to “higher levels of extraversion in American students” would have been more accurate."

  title: "Principal components factor analysis"

  reality: "this phrase is incoherent, because principal components analysis (which is commonly misspelled as “principle components analysis”) and factor analysis are incompatible approaches to data analysis. Principal components analysis is a data reduction technique that relies on the total variance of the variables in a dataset; its principal goal is to create a smaller set of weighted variables (variates) that approximate the variance of the original variables (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0029894\" data-title=\"Weiss, D.

In contrast, factor analysis relies only on the shared variance of the variables in a dataset, and it is designed to identify underlying <i>dimensions</i> that best explain the covariation among these variables (<a href=\"REPLACEME\" data-title=\"Bryant, F. B., and Yarnold, P. R. (1995). “Principal-components analysis and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis,” in Reading and Understanding Multivariate Statistics, eds F. B. Bryant, P. R.

In contrast to principal components analysis, whose primary aim is to simplify a dataset by yielding fewer observed variables, the primary aim of exploratory factor analysis is to identify dimensions that ostensibly account for the covariation among the observed variables."

  reality: "The concepts of “proof” and “confirmation” are incompatible with science, which by its very nature is provisional and self-correcting (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1996.tb10205.x\" data-title=\"McComas, W.

Nor is the evidence for scientific theories dichotomous; theories virtually always vary in their degree of corroboration. As a consequence, no theory in science, including psychological science, should be regarded as strictly proven. Proofs should be confined to the pages of mathematics textbooks and journals (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2007.04.001\" data-title=\"Kanazawa, S. (2008).

  title: "Biological and environmental influences"
  misconception: "This phrase implies that biological influences are necessarily genetic, and cannot be environmental."
  reality: "“Environmental influences” encompass everything external to the organism that affects its behavior following its fertilization as a zygote. As a consequence, the environment comprises not only psychosocial influences, but also non-genetic biological influences, such as nutrition, viruses, and exposure to lead and other toxins (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=22233090\" data-title=\"Nisbett, R.

  title: "Empirical data"
  misconception: ""
  reality: "“Empirical” means based on observation or experience. As a consequence, with the possible exception of information derived from archival sources, all psychological data are empirical (what would “non-empirical” psychological data look like?). Some of the confusion probably stems from the erroneous equation of “empirical” with “experimental” or “quantitative.” Data derived from informal observations, such as non-quantified impressions collected during a psychotherapy session, are also empirical. If writers wish to distinguish numerical data from other sources of data, they should simply call them “quantified data.”"
